I’ve barely scratched the surface of Prolog and logic programming here, but hopefully this gives you a flavour of how different it is, and how to solve simple problems with it. It’s a lot like pure functional programming as found in languages like Haskell, but without any distinction between function inputs and outputs. It’s a really good discipline to learn as it forces you to formalise your understanding of a problem and prove things about it. And, it goes to show how trying to study one topic can lead you to learn all sorts of other things by accident, just by seeing them in an unexpected context.
