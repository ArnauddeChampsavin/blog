[quote, "Superflat and the Postmodern Gothic: Images of Western Modernity in Kuroshitsuji by Waiyee Loh", "Mechademia 7: Lines of Sight"]
____
In _Kuroshitsuji_, the setting of the narrative in late Victorian England forms the premise for a nostalgic simulation, recontextualization and reinscription of seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-century Western European and English architecture, food, and dress. Postmodern nostalgia, as defined by Jameson, is the collective social desire to appropriate an idealized past through aesthetic representation or, to use Baudrillard’s term, simulation.footnote:[Fredric Jameson, “Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,” 203-4] It involves emptying signs of the past of their historical referents, and reinscribing these signs with connotations of a vague “pastness” that construct Barthesian “mythologies” of the past as a “privileged lost object of desire” while effectively effacing “real history.”footnote:[Ibid., 203-7] The shōjo Gothic style in _Kuroshitsuji_ performs this postmodern nostalgic simulation: the signs of Western European and English culture are “flattened” out, stripped of their historical referents, and transformed into idealized hyperreal images of an impeccably elegant and beautiful late Victorian aristocratic lifestyle.

[…]

As a _postmodern_ practice of simulation, recontextualization and reinscription, the shōjo Gothic style ironically idealizes the _modern_. It nostalgically fictionalizes a Western European _past_ in order to articulate the continuing desire of the Japanese nation in the _present_ for the historical phenomenon of Western modernity projected into the _future_ as an ideal to which to aspire.

What struck me is how the described process looks like what happens in the link:http://archiloque.net/blog/hype-process/[the innovation hype process]:
when we try to copy something that we identified as a desirable model, while actively ignoring its context.

So maybe the way we "innovate in IT" is not something specific to IT but something deeper linked to our current cultural context. Next step is it ask consultants to read Fredric Jameson.

Finaly, _postmodern nostalgia_ may be a good term for the process, as it's more descriptive, and holds more _cachet_ than the usual _cargo cult_, while avoiding its colonialist connotations.
